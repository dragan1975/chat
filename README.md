# chat
This is a task I have accomplished to create a chat functionality as a part of a web site template.
The important portion of the code is between lines 54 and 89 (inclusive) as it presents the basic functionality.
The code within lines 90 and 99 is the function that basically displays the chat box or clears it if already displayed.
Please, go through the lines of code to familiarize yourself with my work.
